# A-I-R-O
## A.I POWERED ROVER
A.I is used to optimize the conventional full-time sensor monitored zigzag motion of the line follower robot by training it in the same route.
Here the path of the line follower is convoluted to find the anomalies and then these instances of anomalies (timeframe points) is used for creating a reward function.Then by using reinforcement learning , sensor detection timings , motion control parameters ( frequency, magnitude of each motor current) etc are
optimized for fast and accurate movement
